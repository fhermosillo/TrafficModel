\section{Problem Statement and Mathematical Definition}

Current traffic surveillance systems employ different data models on each stage, so there is no such unified model which allows to capture relationships among all stages. Multidimensional models\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and their decomposition}\DIFdelend , have proven to be very powerful for explicitly representing and extracting multidimensional structures in several fields, including signal processing [], machine learning [],  and telecommunications [], to name \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{just }\DIFaddend a few. Unfortunately, despite its high potential in several fields, multidimensional models have not yet been exploited for the vehicle traffic modeling.



\subsection{Problem Statement}
Given a traffic surveillance video $\mathten{V}_\tau$ of duration $\tau$, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are looking }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{seek }\DIFaddend to formulate a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{comprehensive and flexible }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{complete and flexible tensor }\DIFaddend modeling for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{moving vehicle trafficsupervision based on tensors, that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{supervision of moving vehicles traffic, which }\DIFaddend allows us to link \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{all the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{various }\DIFaddend data models involved during the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{analysis of the }\DIFaddend moving vehicle behavior \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analysis and their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and its }\DIFaddend intrinsic correlations in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{such stages as the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stages such as: }\DIFaddend detection, counting, tracking, occlusion \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{handling and classification, which also facilitates data manipulation and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{management and classification; speed up or facilitate data }\DIFaddend transformation by using certain mathematical operations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, such as multilinear transformations and tensor decompositions.
%DIF < which allows to study the moving vehicle behavior under stages such as detection, counting, tracking, occlusion handling and classification.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of tensor algebra.
}\DIFaddend 



\subsection{Mathematical Definition}
The problem raised above can be understood as a multidimensional modeling of moving vehicles which we called Vehicle Traffic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Features }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Feature }\DIFaddend (VTF) tensor, in such a way that each data model employed, can be represented as a mode or dimension, i.e., $\mathten{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{Model\:1 \times Model\:2 \times \cdots \times Model\:N}$. From this model, other representations could be also derived by either fixing certain dimensions or applying some multidimensional operators on it, in order to study the behavior of moving vehicles at specific modes.

\section{\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tensor-based }\DIFaddend Vehicle Traffic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Modeling}\DIFaddend }
Traditional vehicle traffic models treat data as a one-dimensional features vector, to later be used to capture the internal correlation of historical data. However, vehicle traffic data is multi-mode by experiments, e.g., features mode, time mode, vehicle class mode, occlusion mode, among others, therefore, the current models turn out to be inadequate to capture these multidimensional interactions. The proposal of a multidimensional model will preserve the multi-mode nature of data, while the use of tensor methods such as decompositions, will help to better capture correlations among all modes.

\subsection{Traffic Surveillance Video Modeling}

Given a traffic surveillance video modeled as a four-order tensor $\mathten{V}_\tau \in \mathbb{R}^{W\times H \times D \times Time}$ of $W \times H$ resolution and a duration of $\tau$ seconds, where each pixel is mapped in some color-space of dimension $D$, e.g., grayscale, RGB, then, we will assume that there exist some tensor decomposition model such that the following Equation holds (see Figure \ref{fig:tsvmodel}):

\begin{equation}
\mathten{V}_\tau = \mathten{B} + \mathten{F}
\label{eq:tsvmodel}
\end{equation}

where $\mathten{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{W\times H \times D \times Time}$ is a low-rank tensor which capture low-frequency components the video, i.e., the background, while $\mathten{F} \in \mathbb{R}^{W\times H \times D \times Time}$ is a sparse tensor that contains motion information on the video, in other words it represents the foreground. Note that in Figure \ref{fig:tsvmodel} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{there exist }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{exists }\DIFaddend another tensor denoted by $\mathten{F}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{W\times H \times Time}$, which is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{nothing but a binarized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the binary }\DIFaddend mask of $\mathten{F}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=14 cm]{images/traffic-model.png}
\caption{Illustration of the traffic surveillance video decomposition model.}
\label{fig:tsvmodel}
\end{figure}

For this model, there exist some methods and algorithms that successfully decompose a traffic surveillance video into the background and foreground components such as the Gaussian Mixture Model and Robust Principal Component Analysis (see [X] for review on this decomposition). In this work, we will use a modified version of the Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis or TRPCA in short, originally proposed by Lu, C., et. al., [X] to achieve such decomposition.

\subsection{Moving Vehicle Traffic Tensor Modeling}

From the foreground tensor $\mathten{F}$, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{useful }\DIFdelend information about moving vehicles can be extracted such as \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their trajectory, }\DIFaddend geometry, kinematic and color information by analyzing e.g., the connected components or the historical motion data in $\mathten{F}_m$, which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{could be used at each stage of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can be used later at a particular stage on }\DIFaddend a traffic surveillance system. However, due to the high volume and the multi-mode nature of the data, a one-mode representation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is insufficient to exploit correlations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{results to be not enough to exploit relations }\DIFaddend among all modes. 

To tackle the shortcomings of one-mode models, we proposed to arrange and group the moving vehicle data into a high-order tensor $\mathten{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{I_1 \times \cdots \times I_N}$, which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we call the Vehicle Traffic Features }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{will be called here Vehicle Traffic Feature }\DIFaddend tensor, where its order $ord(\mathten{T}) = N$ will be equal to the number of data models to be used. Therefore, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as long as we desired }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{whenever we want }\DIFaddend to include a new data model, the order of the VTF tensor will \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{be increased }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{increase }\DIFaddend by one. This makes it possible to have a flexible model in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{front }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the face }\DIFaddend of new data models.

}\DIFaddend 


\DIFaddbegin \subsection{\DIFadd{Factorization of the Vehicle Traffic Feature Tensor}}
\DIFadd{Although we can extract a bunch set of multidimensional information to our VFT tensor in different ways, we will focus our attention on two fundamental problems: the pattern recognition and the use of multilinear transformations to enforce low-rank assumptions on tensor models. We start by analyzing the pattern recognition followed by multilinear transformations.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Pattern Recognition}}
\DIFadd{Through the VTF tensor we can exploit the multi-mode correlations, for example, classification-mode, occlusion-mode, and temporal-mode, by Tensor Decompositions (TD), which provide a powerful analytical tool for dealing with multidimensional statics. Common TD employed include the CP-decomposition, Tucker model, HoSVD, and an SVD-based on the t-product called t-SVD, where the choice of a particular decomposition must be application dependent. The CP model is generally used for latent factor extraction, while the Tucker model to uncover hidden pattern in data. On the other hand, the choice of the t-SVD is more suitable when dealing with oriented-tensors.
}

\subsubsection{\DIFadd{Low-rankness by Multilinear Transformations}}
\DIFadd{For pattern learning in data, tensor decompositions allow us to  exploit the high-dimensional structure of the input space, therefore, choosing an appropriate representation of data is a key component to improve pattern recognition. Multilinear transformations aim to express a multidimensional space $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n$ as their multilinear combination by applying some mapping function, i.e., $f : V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n \rightarrow W$, where $V_i$ and $W$ are vector spaces. It allows to find several representations of data that will be more suitable for a particular tensor decomposition model.
}

\DIFadd{As for linear transformations, a multilinear transformation provides different properties than can be exploited according to the problem faced, hence the use of a certain transformation will be also application dependent. Here, we will seek for those multilinear functions which provide a higher-order representation of data while preserving intrinsic low-rank structures. These properties will be needed for both preserving linear mixtures of the input space and avoiding non-separable terms to be exploited in tensors decomposition. For that purpose, we employ two multilinear transformations called Hankelization and L}{\DIFadd{\"o}}\DIFadd{wnerization }[]\DIFadd{, which map the input space to higher-order representations that approximately have low multilinear-rank.

\DIFadd{A common model used in many problems is the (multidimensional) low-rank signal model (see Equation \ref{eq:lowrankmodel}), which states that any observable tensor $\mathten{X}\in\mathbb{K}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$ can be (approximately) decomposed as the sum of two components, a low-rank tensor $\mathten{L}\in\mathbb{K}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$, and a small dense noise tensor $\mathten{N}\in\mathbb{K}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$. Although this decomposition can be solved by several tensor models, such as Tucker, CP, t-SVD or t-RPCA decompositions (see Section \ref{sec:tensoralg}), we only analyze  the t-SVD and t-RPCA.
