\section{Problem Statement and Mathematical Definition}

Current traffic surveillance systems employ different data models on each stage, so there is no such unified model which allows to capture relationships among all stages. Multidimensional models, have proven to be very powerful for explicitly representing and extracting multidimensional structures in several fields, including signal processing [], machine learning [],  and telecommunications [], to name just a few. Unfortunately, despite its high potential in several fields, multidimensional models have not yet been exploited for the vehicle traffic modeling.



\subsection{Problem Statement}
Given a traffic surveillance video $\mathten{V}_\tau$ of duration $\tau$, we seek to formulate a complete and flexible tensor modeling for the supervision of moving vehicles traffic, which allows us to link various data models involved during the analysis of the moving vehicle behavior and its intrinsic interactions among multiple tasks such as: vehicle detection, counting, tracking, occlusion management and classification, as well as to speed up or facilitate data transformation by using certain mathematical operations of tensor algebra.



\subsection{Mathematical Definition}
The problem raised above can be understood as a multidimensional modeling of moving vehicles which we called Vehicle Traffic Feature (VTF) tensor model, in such a way that each data model employed, can be represented as a mode or dimension, i.e., $\mathten{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{Model\:1 \times Model\:2 \times \cdots \times Model\:N}$. Moreover, other representations could be also derived by either fixing certain dimensions or applying some multidimensional operators on it, in order to study the behavior of moving vehicles at specific modes.

\section{Tensor-based Vehicle Traffic Modeling}
Traditional vehicle traffic models treat data as a one-dimensional features vector, to later be used to capture the internal correlation of historical data. However, vehicle traffic data is multi-mode by experiments, e.g., features mode, time mode, vehicle class mode, occlusion mode, among others, therefore, the current models turn out to be inadequate to capture these multidimensional interactions. The proposal of a multidimensional model will preserve the multi-mode nature of data, while the use of tensor methods such as decompositions, will help to better capture correlations among all modes.

\subsection{Traffic Surveillance Video Modeling}

Given a traffic surveillance video modeled as a four-order tensor $\mathten{V}_\tau \in \mathbb{R}^{W\times H \times D \times Time}$ of $W \times H$ resolution and a duration of $\tau$ seconds, and where each pixel is mapped in some color-space of dimension $D$ (e.g., grayscale, RGB). Then, we will assume that there exist some tensor decomposition model such that the following Equation holds (see Figure \ref{fig:tsvmodel}):

\begin{equation}
\mathten{V}_\tau = \mathten{B} + \mathten{F}
\label{eq:tsvmodel}
\end{equation}

where $\mathten{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{W\times H \times D \times Time}$ represents the background, which can be modeled as a low-rank tensor that capture the lowest frequency component of the video, while $\mathten{F} \in \mathbb{R}^{W\times H \times D \times Time}$ represents the foreground modeled as a sparse tensor containing motion information of the video. Note that in Figure \ref{fig:tsvmodel} exists another tensor denoted by $\mathten{F}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{W\times H \times Time}$, which is the mask of $\mathten{F}$ that is obtained by applying some binary operations on $\mathten{F}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=14 cm]{images/traffic-model.png}
\caption{Illustration of the traffic surveillance video decomposition model.}
\label{fig:tsvmodel}
\end{figure}

For this model, there exist some methods and algorithms that successfully decompose a traffic surveillance video into the background and foreground components such as the Gaussian Mixture Model [X], Robust Principal Component Analysis [X], and the pixel-entropy [X] (see [X] for an extensive review on this decomposition). In this work, we will use the Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis or t-RPCA in short, originally proposed by Lu, C., et. al., [X] to achieve such decomposition.

\subsection{Moving Vehicle Traffic Tensor Modeling}

From the foreground tensor $\mathten{F}$, information about moving vehicles can be extracted such as their trajectory, geometry, kinematic or color information, which can be used later at a particular task of a VTS system. However, due to the high-volume of data and multimodality induced by multi-task VTS systems, a one-mode representation results to be not enough to exploit interactions among tasks.

To tackle the shortcomings of one-mode models, we proposed to arrange and group vehicle information as a high-order structure $\mathten{T}^{(N)} \in \mathbb{R}^{I_1 \times \cdots \times I_N}$, here called Vehicle Traffic Feature (VTF) tensor, to model the vehicle behavior of a feature model over multiple tasks. Even though there is a vast set of features which can be extracted from $\mathten{F}$, here we will focus on the geometric feature model, for which we will assume that the behavior of any feature over time can be described by polynomial functions.


%, where the superscript $(N)$ denotes the number of data models embedded on it, in other words its order $N=ord(\mathten{T}^{(N)})$. Therefore, whenever we want to include a new data model, the order of the VTF tensor will increase by one. This will enable us to have a flexible model in the face of new data models.

%In order to construct $\mathten{T}^{(N)}$, during a certain amount of time and for each detected vehicle on the road, we will record a set of geometric features modeled as vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, such as area, while assuming that within the observation time, $M$ vehicles will be detected and tracked. Based on these principles, we arrange the recorded data associated to the $i$th vehicle into a matrix $\mathmat{T}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{Geometric\,Features \times Time}$, such that each $\mathmat{T}_i$ will be stacked to form a new tensor $\mathten{T}^{(3)} \in \mathbb{R}^{Vehicle \times Geometric\,Features \times Time}$ or the third-order VTF tensor which will model the behavior of the vehicle geometric features over time.

In order to construct $\mathten{T}^{(N)}$, for each detected vehicle on the road, we will record a set of geometric features modeled as vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ during a certain amount of time, while assuming that within the observation time, $M$ vehicles will be detected and tracked. Based on these principles, we arrange the historical data of the $i$th vehicle into a matrix $\mathmat{T}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{F \times t}$, where $F$ denotes the number of features, and $t$ the time. Then, each $\mathmat{T}_i$ will be stacked along the third-dimension, such that the VTF tensor $\mathten{T}^{(3)}$ of Equation \ref{eq:vtf3model} will be formed to model the temporal behavior of the vehicles geometric features.
%Timestamp

\begin{equation}
\mathten{T}^{(3)} \in \mathbb{R}^{Vehicle \times Geometric\,Features \times Time}
\label{eq:vtf3model}
\end{equation}

Following the above ideas, additional modes can also be added for a more generalized modeling of the vehicle geometric features. Specifically, in addition to the three modes of vehicles, geometric features and time, we also include the classification and occlusion modes using the VTF tensor model $\mathten{T}^{(5)}$ as Equation \ref{eq:vtf5model} shows to extend our analysis to multiple stages. In this setting, the classification mode will categorize vehicles according to their sizes (e.g., small, midsize, and large), while the occlusion mode, the type of occlusion [] (e.g., non-occluded, lateral, and queue occlusions).

\begin{equation}
\mathten{T}^{(5)} \in \mathbb{R}^{Vehicles \times Geometric\,Features \times Time \times Class \times Occlusion}
\label{eq:vtf5model}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Multilinear Transformations over the Vehicle Traffic Feature Tensor}
For any problem which involves the use of tensor structures, TD allow us to  exploit the intrinsic high-order structure of data, therefore, choosing an appropriate representation of data is a key component to improve any decomposition model. Multilinear transformations, which aim to express a multidimensional vector space $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n$ as their multilinear combination by applying some mapping function of several variables that is linear separately in each variable (see Equation \ref{eq:mltransform}), allow to find other data representations that could be more suitable for a particular TD.


\begin{equation}
f : V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n \rightarrow W
\label{eq:mltransform}
\end{equation}

Similar to linear transformations, multilinear transformations also provide us different properties or structures [] that can be exploited according to the problem faced, hence the use of a particular transformation must be application dependent. Here, we will seek for those functions which provide a higher-order representation of data while inducing well-known intrinsic structures. The first desired property will be needed for both preserving linear mixtures of the source space and avoids to introduce non-separable terms [], while the second property will allow us to enjoy useful properties to be exploited in TD. For that purpose, we employed two deterministic multilinear transformations called Hankelization and L{\"o}wnerization (see Definition \ref{def:hankeltrans} and \ref{def:loewnertrans}), which map the source space into a higher-order structure that have approximately an intrinsic low multilinear-rank. On the other hand, these transformations enjoy some useful properties for data modeling, for example, Hankel structures (Definition \ref{def:hankel}) are known for representing exponential polynomials [], while L{\"o}wner structures (Definition \ref{def:loewner}) show a very close relationship with rational functions [], so that they can be used to model and approximate a wide variety of functions.

\begin{Definition}[Hankel Structure]
	\label{def:hankel}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}[L{\"o}wner Structure]
	\label{def:loewner}
\end{Definition}
	
\begin{Definition}[Hankelization Transformation]
	\label{def:hankeltrans}
	The $K$th-order Hankelization is a transformation that maps any vector $\mathvec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^N$ into a $K$th-order tensor $\mathten{H}^{(K)} \in\mathbb{R}^{I_1 \times \cdots \times I_K}$ called Hankel tensor with constant anti-diagonal hyperplanes as Equation \ref{eq:hankelization} shows, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hankelization transformation, and $N = \sum_{k=1}^{K} {I_k} - K + 1$.
	% Into a Kth-order Hankel tensor with constant ...
	% N = I_1 + ... + I_K - K + 1
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathten{H}^{(K)} = \mathcal{H}(\mathvec{x}) :  h^{(K)}_{i_1,\cdots,i_K} = x_{i_1 + \cdots + i_K - K + 1} % \mathten{H}^{(K)}_{:,:,i_3,\cdots,i_K} = \mathcal{H}(\mathten{H}^{(K-1)}_{:,i_3,\cdots,i_K}), \,
	\label{eq:hankelization}
	\end{equation}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}[L{\"o}wnerization Transformation]
	\label{def:loewnertrans}
	The $K$th-order L{\"o}wnerization is a transformation that maps a vectorized function $\mathvec{x}(\boldsymbol{\phi})\in\mathbb{R}^N$ evaluated at $N$ points $\boldsymbol{\phi}\in\mathbb{R}^{N}$ into a $K$th-order tensor $\mathten{L}^{(K)} \in \mathbb{R}^{I_1 \times \cdots \times I_K}$ called L{\"o}wner tensor such that each entry is defined as Equation \ref{eq:loewnerization} shows, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the $K$th-order L{\"o}wnerization transformation, while $\mathvec{f}^{(p)}$ is the $p$th subset of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$, which holds that  $\mathvec{f}^{(p)} \bigcap \mathvec{f}^{(q)} = \boldsymbol{\emptyset} \:\:\forall p \neq q$, and $\boldsymbol{\phi}=\bigcup_{k=1}^{K} {\mathvec{f}^{(k)}}$.
	% Into a Kth-order Loewner tensor such that ...
	% the pth disjoint subset of Phi, i.e., f^(p) Intersection ...
	
	\begin{equation}
	\mathten{L}^{(K)} = \mathcal{L}(\mathvec{x}) : \ell_{i_1,\cdots,i_K} = \sum_{k=1}^{K}{ \frac{x_{\phi_{k}^{(k)}}}{\prod_{p=1,p\neq k}^{K}{(f_{k}^{(k)} - f_p^{(p)})}}}
	\label{eq:loewnerization}
	\end{equation}
\end{Definition}

An example of the second-order Hankelization and  L{\"o}wnerization transformations are shown in Equations \ref{eq:hankelsample} and \ref{eq:loewnersample} respectively. In Equation \ref{eq:loewnersample}, it is assumed that the set of evaluation points is $\mathvec{t}=\{1,\:\:2,\:\:3,\:\:4\}$ which is partitioned into the two disjoint subsets $\mathvec{f}_1=\{1,\:\:3\}$ and $\mathvec{f}_2=\{2,\:\:4\}$.

\begin{equation}
	\mathten{H}^{(2)} = \mathcal{H}\left(
	\begin{bmatrix}
		7 & 6 & 15 & 12
	\end{bmatrix}
	\right) =
	\begin{bmatrix}
	7 & 6 & 15 \\
	6 & 15 & 12
	\end{bmatrix}
	\label{eq:hankelsample}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\mathten{L}^{(2)} = \mathcal{L}\left(
	\begin{bmatrix}
	7 & 6 & 15 & 12
	\end{bmatrix}
	\right) = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\frac{7-6}{1-2} &  \frac{7-12}{1-4} \\
	\\
	 \frac{15-6}{3-2} & \frac{15-12}{3-4}
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	-1.0000 &  1.6667 \\
	9.0000 & -3.0000
	\end{bmatrix}	
	\label{eq:loewnersample}
\end{equation}

While the use of these transformations appear to be beneficial to exploit low-rank models in TD, an increase in the volume of the target ambient space is inevitable due to the redundancy introduced by them. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality induced by these transformations, we must exploit the intrinsic structures of Hankel and L{\"o}wner. For instance, a tensor–vector multiplication involving a Hankel tensor $\mathten{H}^{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{I_1 \times \cdots \times I_K}$ can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N \log(N))$ flops using the FFT [] instead of the original $\mathcal{O}(\prod_{k=1}^{K} I_k)$ flops required with the naive operation, where $N=\sum_{k=1}^{K} I_k$. Similar to the Hankel case, L{\"o}wner structures can avoid the curse of dimensionality in the case of equidistant points [].

\subsection{Factorization of the Vehicle Traffic Feature Tensor}
Although we can extract a bunch set of multidimensional information to our VFT tensor in different ways, we will focus our attention on two fundamental problems: the pattern recognition for ASDW and the use of multilinear transformations to enforce low-rank assumptions on tensor models. We start by analyzing the pattern recognition of ASDW followed by low-rank models under multilinear transformations.

\subsubsection{Pattern Recognition for ASDW}
Through the VTF model we can exploit multi-mode relations by Tensor Decompositions (TD), which provide a powerful analytical tool for dealing with multidimensional statics. Common TD employed include the CP-decomposition, Tucker model, HoSVD, and an SVD-based on the t-product called t-SVD, where the choice of a particular decomposition must be application dependent. The CP model is generally used for latent factor extraction, while the Tucker model to uncover hidden pattern in data. On the other hand, the choice of the t-SVD is more suitable when dealing with oriented-tensors.

\subsubsection{High-order Low-rank Model under Multilinear Transformations}
%A classical model employed in many real-world applications is the (multidimensional) low-rank signal model [], which states that any measurement tensor $\mathten{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$ can be approximately decomposed as the sum of two components, a low-rank tensor $\mathten{L}\in\mathbb{R}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$, and a small Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) dense noise tensor $\mathten{N}\in\mathbb{R}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$, i.e., $\mathten{X} = \mathten{L} + \mathten{N}$.

A classical model employed in many real-world applications is the (multidimensional) low-rank model (LRM) []. The model assumes that data have approximately low intrinsic dimensionality, e.g. lie either on some low-dimensional subspace or manifold [15,46], or is sparse in some basis [13]. Formally, LRM states that any measurement tensor $\mathten{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$ can be decomposed as $\mathten{X} = \mathten{L} + \mathten{N}$, where $\mathten{L}\in\mathbb{R}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$ is a low-rank tensor, and $\mathten{N}\in\mathbb{R}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$ a residual tensor, a problem that is posed as an optimization problem, commonly solved by minimizing the norm of $\mathten{N}$ as Equation \ref{eq:lowrankmodel} shows.

\begin{equation}
\min_{\mathten{L}} {\left\lVert \mathten{X}-\mathten{L} \right\rVert}_{F}^2
\label{eq:lowrankmodel}
\end{equation}



However, the brittleness of LRM with respect to grossly corrupted observations, often causes non optimal solutions []. For this reason, it is very common to replace \ref{eq:lowrankmodel} by the robust model $\mathten{X} = \mathten{L} + \mathten{S} + \mathten{N}$, called Robust LRM (RLRM), which is formulated as the minimization problem of Equation \ref{eq:lowrankmodel2}, where $\left\lVert \cdot \right\rVert_\star$ denotes the tensor nuclear norm, $\left\lVert \cdot \right\rVert_1$ the $L_1$-norm, and $\mathten{S}\in\mathbb{R}^{I_1\times \cdots I_N}$ is a sparse tensor which models grossly corruptions. It should be notice that this decomposition model can be consider as a generalization of Equation \ref{eq:lowrankmodel}, since in the case of free-corruption, Equation \ref{eq:lowrankmodel2} reduces to \ref{eq:lowrankmodel}.

\begin{equation}
\min_{\mathten{L,S}} {\left\lVert\mathten{L}\right\rVert_\star + \left\lVert\mathten{S}\right\rVert_1}
\label{eq:lowrankmodel2}
\end{equation}

%From most of the TD such as the Tucker, CP and t-SVD decompositions, we can estimate $\mathten{L}$ and $\mathten{N}$, while from just a few decompositions, e.g., t-RPCA, to $\mathten{S}$. Although low-rank models are not limited to the use of specific decompositions, here we will only focus on the use of t-SVD and t-RPCA decompositions for solving Equations \ref{eq:lowrankmodel} and \ref{eq:lowrankmodel2} respectively. 

Although there exist many related works that successfully solve these models [15, 34], the RLRM lacks optimality when the intrinsic structure of a tensor is of high-rank, a situation that often happen in practice, which leads to a global solution that is not exactly low-rank. However, recently Li, C., et. al, [x], showed that a low-rank based matrix completion problem can obtain better performance by exploiting the low-rank structure resulted after transforming an observed matrix $\mathmat{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ into a new representation $\mathmat{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ by applying a set of $K$ linear transformations $\{\mathcal{Q}_i(\cdot)\}_{i=1}^K$, ideas that established the foundations for a framework called Matrix Completion under Multiple linear Transformations (MCMT). MCMT is formulated as an optimization problem (see Equation \ref{eq:mcmtmodel}), where $\mathcal{P}_\Omega(\cdot)$ denotes a downsampling operation over the supporting set $\Omega$, and $\delta\in\mathbb{R}^+$ a small constant.

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\min_{\mathmat{X}} \quad & {\sum_{i=1}^{K} \left\lVert \mathcal{Q}_i(\mathmat{X}) \right\rVert_*}\\
		\textrm{s.t.} \quad & \left\lVert \mathcal{P}_\Omega(\mathmat{X}) - \mathcal{P}_\Omega(\mathmat{Y}) \right\rVert_F < \delta
	\end{aligned}
\label{eq:mcmtmodel}
\end{equation}

Following the ideas behind MCMT on matrices, we propose the high-order RLRM under Multilinear Transformations (HoRLRM$^2$T) with applications for modeling and approximation of functions, where we exploit the additional multi-mode low-rank structures of the transformed tensors.
